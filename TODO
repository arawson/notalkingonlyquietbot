Implement some kind of cheap natural language processing instead of ! commands
Implement removal of dead links
Determine if dead links can be removed automatically
Fart with reverb (admins adding categories of memes, that then get pushed in manually, and later, automatically)
Use Guice to automatically build a bot service (will help with unit tests)


Open questions:
Do commands need coordination on joining audio channels?
Can Discord4J join multiple audio channels?
Should the bot join multiple audio channels? Probably.
